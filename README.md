# JobBoard in C#

Job Board in C# , WinForms.

JobBoard is a personal project based on an earlier school assignment. 
It's a job board done in C# with Winforms (Windows Forms), with a DAL, BO AND UI.

it's coded in layers:
 - An interface layer (UI) -- it's the winforms components
 - a job layer (BO - Business Object) -- methods used by the user
 - a Data Access Layer (DAL) -- medium between the UI and Database
 - a physical layer (Database). -- the sql database where data is stored.
 
 It's the winforms equivalent of job search site.
